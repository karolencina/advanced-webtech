# Advanced Web Tech

## Case Study

The case study describes a Python Flask web-app called DayBook that was built as part of the EU funded SUPERHUB project. The role of daybook was to support end-users in self-reporting their own travel behaviours. However daybook also incorporates nearly all of the features that we have described in the workbook so is a good example of how the various workbook topics can be integrated into a single and consistent web-app.


## Code

[Simple examples](https://github.com/siwells/advanced-webtech/blob/master/code/README.md) from the workbook arranged on a topic-by-topic basis that corresponds to [workbook](https://github.com/siwells/advanced-webtech/tree/master/workbook) chapters.


## Lectures

This [folder](/lectures/README.md) links to a bunch of PDFs of lecture slides. Useful for an overview or outline of a topic that we might cover but only a part of the overall story.

## Topics

Notes & readings for each topic covered in the lectures.


## Workbook

The workbook contains all of the notes and lab exercises for the module. The basic idea is to work through it at a pace of approximately one chapter per week. The workbook is available as LaTeX source code which you'll need to build, or else as a ready built PDF.


### Workbook Source Code

To build the workbook you need to have a working LaTeX environment. Build the PDF using the following command:

    $ pdflatex workbook && pdflatex workbook
