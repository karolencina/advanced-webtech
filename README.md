## Case Study

The case study describes a Python Flask web-app called DayBook that was built as part of the EU funded SUPERHUB project. The role of daybook was to support end-users in self-reporting their own travel behaviours. However daybook also incorporates nearly all of the features that we have described in the workbook so is a good example of how the various workbook topics can be integrated into a single and consistent web-app.


## Code

Simple examples of the topics covered in the workbook arranged on a week-by-week basis that corresponds to trimester weeks.


## Topics

Notes & readings for each topic covered in the lectures.


## Workbook

To build the workbook you need to have a working LaTeX environment. Build the PDF using the following command:

$ pdflatex workbook && pdflatex workbook

Or grab the [pre-built PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k41vw5a49y64nt7/workbook.pdf?dl=1)
